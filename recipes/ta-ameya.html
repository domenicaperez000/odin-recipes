    <h3>SEgyptian Falafel</h3>
    <p>Ta'ameya (Egyptian Falafel) Recipe
        Falafel, or ta'ameya as we call it in Egypt, is an all-time favorite street food. In most parts of the Middle East, falafel is made with ground chickpeas. However, in Egypt, we make it with dried fava beans. They are best served with pita bread, tomato, onions, and tahini sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g split fava beans</li>
        <li>1 red onion</li>
        <li>2 large spring onions</li>
        <li>2 leeks, cut lengthways and washed</li>
        <li>7-8 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>100g fresh coriander </li>
        <li>100g fresh parsley </li>
        <li>100g fresh dill </li>
        <li>5 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda per 500g ta’ameya mix</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sesame seeds</li>
        <li>250ml frying oil (I use grapeseed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The night before, wash the fava beans until the water runs clear then cover with water in a large bowl and leave to soak overnight.</li>
        <li>The next day, roughly cut the leeks, spring onions and red onion and remove the stalks from the fresh herbs. 

        </li>
        <li>In a food processor blend in batches. Add half the fava beans with half the fresh herbs, garlic, onions, leek and salt and blend well. Empty in a separate bowl then add the other half of the ingredients and repeat. </li>
        <li>You should have about 1.7kg of ta’ameya mix that’s dough-like and comes together easily. Split the mix into freezer bags if you’re not using the whole amount. I used about 500g on the day and split the rest of the 1.2kg over 2 bags. It should keep about 3 months in the freezer.

        </li>
        <li>Mix in the baking soda to the ta’ameya dough and heat the oil in a large frying pan. Take about 2 tablespoons of the dough and shape it into a ball in the palms of your hands then gently flatten to make a disc about 5cm wide and 1cm thick. 

        </li>
        <li>Pat your fingers in the sesame seeds then on to the ta’ameya disc, gently flip over to your other palm and repeat adding sesame seeds to both sides.

        </li>
        <li>Fry for 2-3 mins on each side then place on a kitchen towel-lined plate. You can tell it’s ready to flip when it’s dark around the edges.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the rest of the mix. Place as part of a sharing platter or enjoy as sandwiches with some tahina and salata baladi. Bel hana!</li>
    </ol>
