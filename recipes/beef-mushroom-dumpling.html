    <h3>Discover how to make these delicious Beef and Mushroom Dumplings with Olivado Natural Avocado oil</h3>
    <p>Mushrooms are packed with selenium, a trace mineral (meaning the body needs it in smaller quantities than it does macrominerals like calcium) essential in the prevention of oxidative stress, which has been shown to contribute to heart disease. You can also get your selenium fill from Brazil nuts, walnuts, liver, shrimp and fish (halibut, tuna and cod).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole-wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups tapioca flour, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Olive oil cooking spray</li>
        <li>4 oz mushrooms (shiitake, portobello or oyster), finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 lb extra-lean ground beef</li>
        <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>4 tsp rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>4 tsp low-sodium tamari soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh grated ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make dough, bring 1 cup water to a boil on high. In a large bowl, mix together whole-wheat flour, 1/2 cup tapioca flour (reserve remaining 1 cup tapioca flour for formation of dumplings) and salt. Pour boiled water over dry ingredients and stir together with a wooden spoon. Add oil and continue stirring. Mixture will start out crumbly and then form a sticky mass.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle 1 to 2 tbsp tapioca flour on a hard surface, place ball of dough on top and begin to knead. To properly knead dough, dust clean hands with tapioca flour. Using your fist, gently punch centre of dough, spreading it slightly forward. Fold dough in half to form a pair of “lips.” Then turn dough by one-quarter. Sprinkle more tapioca flour onto dough (about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp) and repeat the process several times, for about 10 to 15 minutes. When you start kneading dough, it will be very sticky, but by the time you finish it will be less sticky and will spring to the touch. You will use almost all of the remaining tapioca flour. Divide dough into 2 separate balls and set aside to make filling.</li>
        <li>To make filling, heat a nonstick or cast iron skillet for 1 minute on medium-high. Mist with cooking spray and heat for another minute. Add mushrooms and sauté for about 3 minutes or until just cooked; mushrooms are cooked when they do not stick to the bottom of the pan and appear to be wet.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together beef, mushrooms, onions, vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, pepper and cinnamon (it will be a very wet mixture).
        </li>
        <li>To make dumplings, first roll each dough half with your hands on a lightly floured surface, forming a “sausage” that is about the thickness of a hot dog. Slice into 1-inch segments and form each segment into a small dough ball.</li>
        <li>To assemble dumplings, lightly flour clean hands and press each small dough ball with fingers until it is a flat circle, about 2 to 3 inches in diameter. Place 1/2 to 3/4 tsp beef mixture on each circle and then gently wrap up dumpling by bringing up the sides. Pinch 2 sides together, then bring up the other 2 sides and pinch dough in center until it sticks.
        </li>
        <li>To cook, steam for 20 minutes in a steam cooker.</li>
    </ol>
